# Python-Compiler-For-CutePy
This project is implemented by the undergraduate students: -Vasileios Ioannis Bouzampalidis, -Alexandros Agapitos Christodoulou

## Main Objective:
This is a project aimed at creating a custom compiler for the custom made CutePy programming language. This compiler is designed to interpret and compile code written in CutePy, a language with unique grammar rules and syntax. The main goal of this project is to facilitate the execution and debugging of CutePy programs by providing a reliable and efficient compilation process.

## Key Features:
- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the CutePy source code to identify keywords, operators, delimiters, and other syntactic elements.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Parses the tokenized code to ensure it adheres to the CutePy grammar rules.
- **Intermediate Code Generation:** Translates the parsed code into intermediate representations.
- **Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages for easier debugging.

## Technical Details:
**Programming Language:** The compiler is written in Python, leveraging its robust libraries and tools for string manipulation, parsing, and more.
**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Development and testing of the compiler were conducted using Visual Studio Code.

## To Run the Program:
python cutePy_4744_4839.py your_source_file.cpy
